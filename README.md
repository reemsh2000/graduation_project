### 1.1 Introduction 

Healthy lifestyle helps to keep and improve peopleâ€™s health and well-being. A healthy lifestyle will help a person live a happy life without being worried about getting sick or infected by a disease. Furthermore, having a healthy lifestyle might help to prolong your life more than those who are not concerned about their health. Hence, a healthy diet and regular exercise are the best ways to practice a healthy lifestyle.
